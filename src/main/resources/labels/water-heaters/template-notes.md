For templates which give the user the option to select "Able to work only during off-peak hours", add the hasOffPeakMode class to the offPeakMode element if it's selected

For templates where the inside Db measurement is optional, if the user has supplied a value, add the hasInsideDb class to the insideDbSection element. By default, this element isn't shown.

For 'packages of water heater and solar device':
* if the user has said that a solar collector may be included, add the hasSolarCollector class to the solarCollector element
* if the user has said that a hot water storage tank may be included, add the hasHotWaterStorageTank class to the hotWaterStorageTank element.
