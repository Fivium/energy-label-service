For templates which give the user the option to select "Able to work only during off-peak hours", add the hasOffPeakMode class to the offPeakMode element if it's selected

For templates where the inside Db measurement is optional, if the user has supplied a value, add the hasInsideDb class to the insideDbSection element. By default, this element isn't shown.
