For the 2010 household refrigerating appliances templates:
* If they have said it doesn't have any "compartments that do not merit a star rating" (fridge compartments) display "-" in the leftmost box (milk carton) instead of a number
* If they have said it doesn't have any "frozen-food storage compartments that merit a star rating" (freezer compartments) display "-" in the middle box (snowflake) instead of a number
* If it DOES have freezer comparments, add class starRating0 to starRating4 to the starRating element to display the appropriate star rating for the freezer comparments

For the 2021 household refrigerating appliances templates:
* If they have said it has fridge compartments, add the hasFridgeSection class to the fridgeSection element
* If they have said it has freezer compartments, add the hasFreezerSection class to the freezerSection element
* Add the classes noiseClassA through to noiseClassD to the noiseClass element to make the applicable noise class rating larger and bold. This should be in addition to the classes already on the element.
