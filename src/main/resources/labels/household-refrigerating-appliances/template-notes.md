For the household refrigerating appliances templates:
* If they have said it doesn't have any "compartments that do not merit a star rating" (fridge compartments) display "-" in the leftmost box (milk carton) instead of a number
* If they have said it doesn't have any "frozen-food storage compartments that merit a star rating" (freezer compartments) display "-" in the middle box (snowflake) instead of a number
* If it DOES have freezer comparments, add class starRating0 to starRating4 to the starRating element to display the appropriate star rating for the freezer comparments
